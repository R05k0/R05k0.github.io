So here we are . Me the screen. A little over 3 moths ago, I decide to start this journey.  I have absolutley no idea what I am doing. I do know one thing however.  This will be the most challenging thing I have ever decided to do. I have been in the food industry for the past 20 years, and I am starting completley over. Why you may ask? Cause Im crazy like that. The real answer is a bit more informative. Im in an industry that was decimated within a month. Resturaunts  in my my community that had been  staples , shuddered over night. Even. my own place closed and only now is startign to recover. I saw this and for the first time in my proffesional career I was afraid of what was to come next. My job was no longer secure.Im a father of 3 and that teified me .   A virus had made it  clear that the resturant experience as we know it is going to change , and there would be no clear sign of when/if it would go back....
       Insert crazy.   
			 So what does a 38 year old Chef  with no experience coding , looping or , using if statemnets do? You guessed it. Apply to become a Software Engineer , Yay! I'm in it for the security it can provide , as well as the challenge; but I would be lying if I wasn't excited about the mooooolah . Anyway, I'm really excited either way of becoming a Software engineer.
			 Its not the best Ive ever wrote but its the realist ...
